# Angular 2 with Webpack

This is based on the code on setting up webpack from the article 
[
Setting Up Angular 2 with Webpack](https://semaphoreci.com/community/tutorials/setting-up-angular-2-with-webpack)

I've updated it to use webpack 2 and added some additional modules.

To save on dev time, the are two package.json files, one without test suites and one with.

This code sets up an Angular 2 project with Webpack is a simple way while
also providing the configuration for unit testing.

To install all the dependencies run:

```shell
npm i
```

For single, headless tests use:

```shell
npm run test:headless
```

To run code in a browser user:

```shell
npm start
```
